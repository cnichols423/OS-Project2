Cohen Nichols
OS Project 2

This is the Bankers Algorithim for deadlock avoidance project. from the code that I wrote it did output that it was in a safe state. This project however I found to be a little easier and was actually able to get the program to compile and be in seperate files. I tried to get the files to not be hard coded in so youd be able to use any file name/ set of numbers from different files, but I was unable to get it to work.

The output for my complied code was - "not safe !" -
